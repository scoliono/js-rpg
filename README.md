## How to Install

1. Install Node.js for your system.

2. Get the code from this Git repository using `git clone` or by downloading the .zip, if you're not familiar with Git.

3. Open Terminal or Command Prompt on your computer and navigate to the folder with the code using `cd`.

4. Run `npm i` once to install dependencies.

5. Run `npm start` to start the game.

6. (Optional) To test multiplayer over the Internet, the easiest way to host a server is to use a project on [repl.it](https://repl.it), so that you don't have to mess around with your computer's firewall settings. Select `Multiplayer`, then `Host a Server` from the main menu. Once the server starts, repl.it will open up a blank browser window with a `repl.co` address, and you should use that to join the game from your and your friends' computers.
